## Usage
<br>1- Extract the file from the rar.</br>
<br>2- Before running the application, create a database suitable for the application with postgresql. </br>
<br>3- The database is not shared for privacy reasons. I can help you if you contact me.</br>
<br>4- Click ogrenciTransriptUyglm.sln for the program to work.</br>
<br>5- After following the instructions above, the program screen will appear.</br>
<br>6- All required rules and criteria were followed in the application. We tried to write original code so that the assignment is not similar to other assignments. </br>
<br>7- I tried to be careful in using Turkish characters while writing the program.</br>
<br>8- However, having Turkish characters in the file content does not pose a problem.</br>


<br><h2>Sample run </h2></br>
<br>Extract the file from the rar</br>
<br>Open the file</br>
<br>Run ogrenciTransriptUyglm.sln in the file directory.</br>
